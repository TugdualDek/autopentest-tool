# Vulnerability Testing and Attack Simulation Framework

## Overview

This project is an Ansible-like tool dedicated to vulnerability testing and cybersecurity attack simulations. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for security professionals to create, manage, and execute various security tests and attack scenarios.

## Key Features

- Modular Plugin System: Easily extend the framework's capabilities by creating and adding your own plugins.
- YAML-based Configuration: Define attack scenarios and test workflows using simple, human-readable YAML files.
- Customizable Workflows: Create complex, multi-stage security tests and attack simulations.
- Variable Management: Use dynamic variables throughout your workflows for flexible and reusable configurations.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TugdualDek/autopentest-tool/
```

Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the framework:

```
python main.py
```

## Creating Plugins

To add new functionality to the framework, you can create custom plugins:

- Create a new Python file in the plugins directory.
- Define a class that inherits from BasePlugin.
- Implement your desired methods.

Example:
```python
from plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin

class MyCustomPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def my_custom_action(self, param1, param2):
        # Implement your custom action here
        pass
```

## Configuration Files

Create YAML configuration files to define your attack scenarios and test workflows. Place these files in the config directory. Example:

```yaml
name: My Custom Attack Scenario

stages:
  - name: Reconnaissance
    steps:
      - action: Scan target
        MyCustomPlugin.my_custom_action:
          param1: value1
          param2: value2
        success_criteria:
          - custom_criterion_met
```
